# TimeGiver
 TimeGiver is an open-source, highly-customizable circadian lighting rhythm generator that empowers connected lighting systems to support a healthy cycle of sleep and wakefulness.  It takes arguments such as wake time and sunset length and returns an appropriate set of lighting parameters such as brightness and color temperature for the current moment.  Rhythms can be generated based on just a few parameters using appropriate defaults or customized extensively according to desired maximums, minimums, rates of change, and slope shapes.  TimeGiver also includes a sunlight simulator that mimics the natural blue-yellow color gradient of sunlight, producing a unique combination of colors for every time of day that reproduces everything from the crisp blue noontime to the golden hues of late afternoon and mellow blues of dusk, all without compromising color rendering.

## Illustrations
The stylized graphs below show some very simple examples of the kind of light scheduling information that can be generated on the fly using TimeGiver.
